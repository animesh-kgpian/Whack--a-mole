# Whack-a-mole
Once the game starts, the moles will begin to pop up from their holes at random. The object of the game is to force the individual moles back into their holes by whacking them directly on the head with the mallet. Each mole you hit is worth 10 points.This is the usual setup of the game but I designed it a bit different.

This game consists of 9 tiles. There are two components:-
1) A plant
2) A Mole
Out of these 9 tile, the mole or the plant can pop out randomly from any of these tiles for a fixed interval of time. If the player clicks on the mole, score increases by 10 but if he/she clicks on the plant, game is over.
